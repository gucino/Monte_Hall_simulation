#Objective
This code aims to simulate the Monte Hall problem and prove that
always switch strategy have higher chance of wining the prize.

#Rules
There are 3 doors where there is a prize behind 1 of 3 doors. 
The person will select 1 of the 3 doors, the game hoster will open 1 more door
and ask whether the person want to switch or stay at the same door.

#result
The experiment is conducted by playing the game 1000 times.
Each time the person's select position and the prize's position are randomly assigned.
Switching have more chance of wining as shown in 3_doors.png.
The experiment is made even more extreme by increasing the number of doors.
We found that, shown in 10_and_3_doors.png
the chance of wining using switching strategy in 10 doors game is higher 
than the chance of wining using switching strategy in 3 doors game. 
While the chance of wining using stay strategy in 10 doors game is lower 
than the chance of wining using stay strategy in 3 doors game.
